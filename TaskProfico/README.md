# Game App

App was written in Swift. Design was made with a storyboard, where I used: TableViewController,  ViewController,  ImageView and Labels. The purpose of the app is fetching data from RAWG database (Genres and their games).
The user can on first launch of the app choose their genres, and based on their choice they will get a list of games. On next launches of the app the list of games is loaded after being stored locally. 

Using the settings button the user can change their genres of choice (which changes their list of games).
